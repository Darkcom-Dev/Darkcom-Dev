# About me

I started programming in 2010 by developing video games in Unity; I built up a large "graveyard" of projects until my laptop's power and my eyesight could no longer keep up. In 2018, I began programming in Python, which has since become my main language. I've developed small tools that make my daily life easier. For many years, I was a blogger until my website was hacked; I hope to revive it someday. Currently, I am preparing to become a Backend Developer.
